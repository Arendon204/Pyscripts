#Intuition
        #The problem requires finding the longest common prefix among an array of strings. My initial thought is to compare characters at the same position across all strings. If they all match, that character is part of the common prefix; otherwise, the comparison stops, and the common prefix found so far is returned.


class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        #Initialize an empty string ans to store the longest common prefix.
        ans = ""
        #Iterate over the characters of the first string in the array, as the prefix must match from the start of each string.
        for i in range(len(min(strs))):
            s = strs[0][i]
            
#Compare the character in the first string with the corresponding character in all other strings.
            for j in range(len(strs)):
                
#If any string has a different character at the current position, return the prefix found so far (ans).
                if strs[j][i] != s:
                    return ans
                    
            #If all strings match at the current position, add the character to ans.

            ans += s

        #If the loop completes, the entire first string is a common prefix, so return ans

        return ans

        #This solution effectively finds the longest common prefix by iteratively comparing characters across all strings in the input list.
